1. What is the difference between a block element and an inline element? 
Give few examples of block and inline tags which we have in HTML.

1. Block-level elements:
    - Block-level elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width available to them.
    - They create a "block" of content, which means that other elements cannot appear to their left or right unless they are floated or positioned.
    - Block-level elements can have both width and height specified.
    - Examples of block-level elements: **`<div>`**, **`<p>`**, **`<h1>`** to **`<h6>`**, **`<ul>`**, **`<ol>`**, **`<li>`**, **`<form>`**, **`<header>`**, **`<footer>`**, **`<section>`**, **`<nav>`**, **`<article>`**, etc.

2. Inline elements:
    - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up the necessary width to display their content.
    - They flow within the surrounding text and allow other elements to appear to their left and right.
    - Inline elements cannot have width and height specified; they automatically adjust to the size of their content.
    - Examples of inline elements: **`<span>`**, **`<a>`**, **`<strong>`**, **`<em>`**, **`<img>`**, **`<input>`**, **`<label>`**, **`<button>`**, **`<select>`**, **`<textarea>`**, **`<code>`**, etc.


2. In how many ways you can declare CSS to an HTML ?

a. direct in tag : inline style
<h1 style="color:red">some text</h1>

b. create the style tag called Internal CSS:
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</body>

c.  External CSS ; create the external css file by using .css and link them 
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"> put here your css file name 
</head>

3. What is selector specificity in CSS and how does it determine the styles applied to elements?
inline style | style=""  1000
Id           | #         100
class        | .         10
Typeselector | h1{}      1
Universal    | *         0  


inline style : highest preority 1000  eg
//  internal css
<style>
      div{
        color: blue    
      }
</style>


<div style="color:red">Color me</div>   // inline style

the color of the div comes red beacuse the inline have highest preiority if we use external file the color also comes red 


4. What are CSS positions? What are the position types in CSS? What is the default position property in CSS?
CSS positions determine how an element is positioned within its parent container 
Eg index.html
 
a. static position (default) : the normal position of an HTML elements as per the document it is now shown beacuse the default behaviour of html elements is static

b. Relative:
- The **`relative`** position type allows you to position an element relative to its normal position.
- When an element is positioned relatively, it can be moved using the **`top`**, **`bottom`**, **`left`**, and **`right`** properties.
- Relative positioning does not affect the position of other elements on the page.
.box {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px; /* Move 10 pixels down */
  left: 20px; /* Move 20 pixels to the right */
}

c. Absolute:
Absolutely positioned elements are like free-floating objects that are taken out of the normal document flow.
Absolutely positioned elements can overlap with other elements.
You can use top, left, right, and bottom properties to position the element from the edges of its containing block.
.popup {
  position: absolute;
  top: 100px; /* Position 100 pixels from the top edge */
  left: 50%; /* Position at the middle horizontally */
  transform: translateX(-50%); /* Center horizontally */
}


d. Fixed:
Fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal document flow and are not affected by scrolling.
They remain fixed in their specified position even when the page is scrolled.

e. 5. Sticky:
    - The **`sticky`** position type is a hybrid of **`relative`** and **`fixed`**.
    - It positions an element based on its normal position in the document flow until a specified threshold is reached.
    - Once the threshold is reached during scrolling, the element behaves like a **`fixed`** positioned element and remains fixed in its position.



5. What is the concept of semantic tags in HTML? Can you provide a few examples to illustrate their usage?
are those tags which carry a meaning along with them eg
<header></header>   Represents the introductory
<nav></nav>       Denotes a section containing navigation links.
<fotter>
<main>: Represents the main content of the document,
<article>: Defines a self-contained composition or independent piece of content.
